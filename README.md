# Election-Analysis Final Review

## Overview of Election Audit:

It was no surprise that Denver had the largest voter turnout in the election by a large margin.  Denver accounted for 306,055 out of the 369,711 total votes.  Diana DeGetter won the election and secured over 73% of the total votes.  This was a successful analysis as we were able to determine the winner with a breakdown of the votes by county.  There was an error in the code was returning the incorrect winning vote getter that I need to go over with my tutor and resubmit.

## Election Audit Summary:

This can be a useful analysis for any election, no matter the county or candidates.  If we were to enter in a new data file (csv), with the same column and row formatting, the script would require no change, and would run and the provide the county breakdown, candidate breakdown, and the highest turnout/winner for each.  We could modify the script by adding another category to sort or analyze by.  For example, if we were provided the gender of each voter, or the age of each voter, we could modify the script and show the gender for each breakdown for each candidate.  We could also modify the script to show a voter age breakdown based on the voter county.
